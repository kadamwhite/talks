#### what has changed

???

- Surprisingly little in some ways
- iterative improvement
- endpoints, search
- filtering & perf
- But most of all,

### Society if WP had a REST API
<!-- .element: class="meme" -->

???

We said, "everybody, obviously!" Look what you could do with it!
In retrospect, five years ago we were all going around to conferences like this and prosletyzing a utopian vision of how WP could be if we merely increased the size of the codebase by 2%.

### Society if it _doesn't_ get one
<!-- .element: class="meme bottom" -->

???

Though, both to honor the day -- may the fourth be with you -- and to be more transparent, maybe it&rsquo;s worth admitting that to our eyes, it was so self-evident that this was good that in our talks that year we were really saying that WordPress _without_ such API didn't bear thinking about,

A core REST API gives plugin developers

# interoperability
<!-- .element: class="italic" -->

???

The most convincing argument was from plugin developers, who advocated for the API quite heavily throughout 2016. The writing was on the wall about needing data access from JS, and if WP core didn't provide an opinion about how to model core content, each plugin would have to roll their own. Without a central authority, we'd end up with a big mess.

### Conditional Merge

**_and [metrics for success](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/10/19/wordpress-rest-api-success-metrics/)_**

- Plugin utilization
- Distributed theme utilization
- Custom development implementations
- Core development and feature projects

???

We hadn't demonstrated what benefit this would have that would justify putting it onto a quarter of the web.

In the end we did get the go-ahead to merge the API into core, but it was conditional. We've got to broaden our usage and demonstrate the power of the REST API at scale.

### One feature project within

- got by on a technicality with G

## should we have waited?
<!-- .element: class="italic" -->

---

An API contract is a

# standard
<!-- .element: class="italic" -->

???

This isn't a surprise to many here, I'm sure, but what we were doing was proposing a data standard for use across WordPress. Standards enable collaboration and interaction, as well as data portability

Broader use than if we'd waited for G

In WP this can be modified at runtime with the map_meta_cap and user_can filters

## Data is only as good as what you can do with it

???

- Inaccessible data is useless, as is untrustable data
- Can't leave access as an afterthought

- Could use more maintainers, but not alone in that
  - Shout-out to Timothy, jonny, alain, felix, george, etc
- words matter
- mixed signals from Leadership
  - I don't think matt was a good steward

- Components own their own endpoints
- API team serves as documentation & standards body

## summary
<!-- .element: class="italic" -->

- Know why the data standard matters
- Understand the nuances of permissions & access
- Provide a documented authentication solution
- Plan for versioning from Day 1
- It&rsquo;s never &ldquo;us _vs_ them&rdquo;; FOSS is a community effort
- Curb cutting effect
