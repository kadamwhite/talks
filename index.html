                <span class="talk-location">WordCamp San Francisco, October 2014</span>
                <p class="blurb" style="display: none;">On a recent project at Bocoup, my team was looking for the best available Node.js content management system&hellip; and we picked WordPress! Our clients got all the benefits of WP’s content editing interface, and with the in-development REST API plugin we were able to use that content in our app without precluding any of our other technology choices. This talk will use our project as a case study to share lessons we learned while building a Node client for the API, and why we’re so excited about what the next year holds for the evolution of WordPress as a content platform.</p>

                <p class="blurb" style="display: none;">We’re long past the days where a few lines of JavaScript in a single .js file cut the mustard, modern web applications can involve thousands of lines over hundreds of files, and WordPress themes and plugins are heading in that direction fast. You can make your codebase much easier to maintain and expand by breaking your scripts up into modules, encapsulating different logical units in their own files. All these files make developing and debugging simpler but they can take a while to load, so we’ll also look at how to use a build tool to boil all those files back down into a single script for when you’re ready to release the code to your users.</p>

You can make your codebase much easier to maintain and expand by breaking your scripts up into modules, encapsulating different logical units in their own files. We will learn several ways to modularize your code, with a focus on AMD and Require.js. All these files can take a while to load, so we’ll also look at how to use a build tool to author your code in dozens of files without compromising performance for your end users. To close, we’ll take a quick peek into the future to discover the native module syntax coming in the next version of JavaScript!</p>

                <span class="talk-location">WordCamp Boston, October 2013</span>
                <p class="blurb" style="display: none;">WordPress 3.6 includes version 1.0 of Backbone.js, the JavaScript library that powers the new WordPress media uploader. It can be intimidating to get started with a library like Backbone, but it is a powerful tool for developers of WordPress plugins, themes and web apps alike. In this session we’ll look at several ways to begin integrating Backbone into your WordPress themes and plugins, including a step-by-step demonstration of how Backbone can improve the quality of your existing jQuery code. There’s no reason to stop there, though—to close we’ll walk through other exciting ways to use Backbone alongside WordPress, including how to make a standalone Backbone application that only uses WordPress for its data!</p>
