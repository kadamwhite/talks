## Why have a website?



# Get Exposure

Note: More people can see your work online than could ever visit your studio during SOS



# Build a Following

Note: Give your fans a central place to see your existing work and to check back for new work



# Curate yourself

Note: Put your best foot forward



# What Makes a Good
# Artist's Website?



## The Basics:

* Something to Look At
* Something to Read
* Focused Content
* Updated Frequently!



# Something to Look At



## High-Quality Images

Your work is only as good as the  
scan or photo that you upload



## Small Image Files

Smaller image files make your site load faster!

Use Photoshop's "Save for Web" or equivalent <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Avoid uploading images larger than ~1000px on a side <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Something to Read



## Artist's statement



## Biography



## Descriptions of the work

Note: Shapes how other people talk about you, and can help with search engines



## Explain your process



## Other commentary&mdash;be yourself!



# Focused Content



## You are an editor



## Ask yourself:

*Does this content complement my work,*

*or distract from it?*



# Updated Frequently



## Add New Work



## Re-Curate the Old

# Kinds of
# Art Websites



## Galleries vs Blogs



Do you just want to showcase  
your best work,



or to engage readers  
in your process?



## Gallery Sites

* Less frequent, larger updates
* More static/highly-curated content
* Less work per website page
* Work divided up by medium or theme
* Supported by artist's statement, CV, etc



## A Common Gallery Site

## Click through to larger images

## Supports text as well

## Blog-Style Sites

* More frequent, smaller updates
* More work per website page
* Types of work may be more intermixed
* Work can be interspersed with other content



## You can do both in one site!




Structure your site's content with  
menus, tags and categories:

Part of your site can be gallery-  
style, and part of it can be a blog



## There is no right answer

Layout doesn't change the content: pick  
the layout style that feels best for you!



## General Wisdom

"Busy" designs can overwhelm content.

*e.g.*, Don't Do This:

Consider how your theme/layout represents your art

## Look for photo themes

Most themes designed for photographers can  
be used as-is by artists in *any* medium



## All themes may require
## some adjustments!

Categories, menus, widgets and featured images are  
often handled slightly differently per theme, so it may  
take some time to "settle in" to your chosen theme.
