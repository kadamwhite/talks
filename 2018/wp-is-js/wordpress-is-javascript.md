Thank you `____`, and thank you Empire for having me today. As `____` said, my name is K Adam White, you can call me KAdam.

To start, I think it's important to acknowledge that the title of my talk is a lie. It's clickbait at best.

### WordPress isn&rsquo;t JavaScript&hellip;

???

WordPress is a 15-year-old PHP blogging application.

This makes sense, because WordPress dates from a time before the modern concept of a JavaScript web app even existed. All of the libraries Kelly mentioned in the presentation before this had yet to be created.

What WordPress _is_ is an application (and community of developers and writers surrounding it) that has grown and evolved alongside the web platform.

Grew to almost a third of all websites
Nothing stays the same
No major rewrite

We do all this by being mindful of the effect our decisions have. In WP 4.4 we added responsive image handling with `srcset` to WP core. The percentages on the Y axes may be small, but you can see the day that version was released in this Chrome Platform graph of how many pages use `srcset`

Apache foundation announced they couldn't accept it

A year ago this week, Matt announced WordPress could not either

A year ago _this_ week, WordPress adopted it

> React has the biggest open source JavaScript ecosystem and support behind it. It has the job market, it has the most components, most active maintainers&hellip;

> A WordPress developer who wants to stay up to date and learn new things can now start learning React.

The sentiment in the community was one of relief. As much as I'd liked to have been able to explore Vue personally, React brings major benefits

### WordPress has always been about websites, but it’s not just about websites. It’s about freedom, about possibility, and about carving out your own livelihood

<br>

<small>_~ Matt Mullenweg, [We Called It Gutenberg For A Reason](https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/)_</small>

???

Gutenberg is technically complex, but ideologically it is about going back to basics: what are we trying to build with WordPress? what is the goal?

## Democratize Publishing

### WordPress cannot stay in its bubble.<br>It must rub against other bubbles, vigorously.

???

As John Maeda, a leading designer who serves as the the Global Head of Computational Design and Inclusion at Automattic, put it, creativity comes from juxtapositions.

We have deeply ingrained ways of thinking about WordPress. We need outside input to keep us objective, and to make sure we make the best decisions we can.
