Thank you `____`, and thank you Empire for having me today. As `____` said, my name is K Adam White, you can call me KAdam.

To start, I think it's important to acknowledge that the title of my talk is a lie. It's clickbait at best.

This makes sense, because WordPress dates from a time before the modern concept of a JavaScript web app even existed. All of the libraries Kelly mentioned in the presentation before this had yet to be created.

As John Maeda, a leading designer who serves as the the Global Head of Computational Design and Inclusion at Automattic, put it, creativity comes from juxtapositions.

We have deeply ingrained ways of thinking about WordPress. We need outside input to keep us objective, and to make sure we make the best decisions we can.
