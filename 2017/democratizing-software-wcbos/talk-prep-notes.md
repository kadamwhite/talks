> If you ask a WordPress contributor what the project’s goal is, chances are we’ll say “to democratize publishing.” However, for over a decade the community that has grown around WordPress has been doing something even more important: our community is democratizing software itself. By creating one of the only web communities to include everybody from writers and photographers to interaction designers and senior software architects, WordPress has done what often seems impossible in Open Source software: we have built a product not just for ourselves, but for everyone. The future of WordPress rests on our ability to recognize and celebrate the spectrum of our community.

- Keynote. Thank you. Honored.
- It is oft said in the WordPress sphere is "democratizing publishing" (see: Automattic.com, slack sign-in from Mark J)
- First let us establish that software is code, and the word code presents a problem.

**THIS SECTION EXCERPTED FROM BOSTOCK KEYNOTE**

> The word "code" "suggests impenetrability" -- it is "hardly human-friendly"
> 
> > Use this in Maine talk -- also, Matrix screen is a good illustration of this
> 
> Brett Victor: "Programming is blindly manipulating symbols." "by blindly he means we cannot see the results of our manipulation." (code->reload->see feedback loop) "We don't see the output of our program directly, we operate in abstractions.
> 
> "Programs are inscrutable"
> 
> "If coding requires inhuman ability, why don't we do something else?"
> 
> [because] "Code has unparalleled expressiveness." it is "the most general" tool we have
> 
> "If your goal is to help people gain insight, we must consider the general problem of how people code"
> 
> Brett Victor, Kill Math: "The power to understand and predict the quantities of the world should not be restricted..."

**END EXCERPT**

- So, then, "Democratizing Software," eh? What does that mean.
    + Definition of Democratize
        * > : to make (something) available to all people : to make it possible for all people to understand (something)
        * https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democratize
- "All People." Looking at this room, not much is true about all of us; the WP community is diverse and multivariate.
- But we are all human, so we are all born, we all die, and we all started out not knowing how to code.
- As I reflect on the community that has built up around WordPress I have come to believe that we are in a unique position to encourage the democratization of software, by making it a natural extension of the democratization of publishing
    + Almost no other (current) open-source software community includes both absolute beginners and incredibly experienced developers.
- WordPress is for Learners


## To Hit

- Four Freedoms:
    + "use, study, share and improve the software." https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html
    + From https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html
        * The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
        * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
        * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
        * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- @wilto: "there is a story to be told about an entire generation of webdevs and myspace. you could spin a _narrative_ outta that"
- https://medium.com/glitch/the-web-was-supposed-to-be-a-thing-we-make-c023b6e7f56a "The web was supposed to be a think we make" (c.f. glitch)
- wilto: @kadamwhite man, that’s a talk framing that will get some hooks in an audience; you start talkin’ myspace “hacks” and livejournal “themes” and 95% of the crowd is gonna relate
- Wilto: the visuals basically produce themselves. all blingee gifs
- Wilto: `CURRENT MOOD: wordpress lol`

- with social networks, "Curiosity is removed" (my words) -- emily, "to have content on the internet I had to learn FTP... I had to figure out how that worked. That bizarre, magical way in which things are flung into the internet"
- EHG: "What's the draw, of having things on the internet? [Would I care] if I didn't have have something easy to use in front of you"

- kadamwhite:the goal is to explain why I care about WP in terms of it continuing that lineage of encouraging curiosity and meddling, in our current age of squarespace and facebook
- because the wordpress dev community’s oft-spoken goal is to “democratize publishing,” and I think the way they’re doing it democratizes software, too — so the thing I think is most important for the future of the platform is to not make decisions that break the path from “curious” to “enabled”
- this comes up a lot when we talk about new technology decisions and new interfaces. If we fragment WP into a bunch of single-page apps for our own convenience, what is lost? How can we improve the developer experience without making it harder to customize your own site? If you make a product that CAN be customized, but resists customization, that seems to go against one of the four software freedoms

================

Free as in freedom is often inaccessible: don't have time to attend symposium, don't live in place with academic resources, don't have background to engage with technical resources -- prohibits engagement with the available resources

Ingredients list with "open source" inserted: share code from PHP and explain I don't know what it does either;

Retool pitch for talk to organizers to get at, rather than blindly trusting "open source," understand what elements of our community it is that keeps us open to new blood and focused on the needs of our users, for in there lies the possibility for the  future of the platform
