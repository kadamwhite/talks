## So. Who Are You Folks?



## WordPress & JavaScript

![wp heart](../backbone-wordpress/images/wp-hearts-js.png)



![JS Logo](../backbone-wordpress/images/js-logo.png)



![jQuery](../backbone-wordpress/images/jquery.png)



## A Bit of History



## In the beginning...



![Prototype.js logo](../backbone-wordpress/images/prototypejs_org_02.png)

* Did a lot of what jQuery does (even uses `$`)
* Works by modifying native JS prototypes (messy)
* Wasn't a perfect solution for WP



## jQuery: @since 2.2.0

![Changeset 4816](../backbone-wordpress/images/changeset-4816.png)

<small>*jQuery [added to WordPress](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4816/) in January '07 by Matt Mullenweg*</small>



## The Whole Family

Prototype is still there (script-loader.php L108):
```php
// WordPress no longer uses or bundles Prototype or
// script.aculo.us. These are now pulled from an external source.
$scripts->add( 'prototype',
  '//ajax.googleapis.com/[...]prototype.js',
  array(), '1.7.1'
);
```
Of the 134 scripts defined in script-loader.php,<br />
87 scripts (over **60%**) relate to jQuery



## Why was jQuery So Awesome?



## Focus

Designed to [do specific things really well](http://jquery.com/#home-content):

* HTML document traversal
* Event handling
* Ajax interaction
* Animation



## Really good at this problem:

# BUT



![Bowl of Spaghetti, from WikiMedia Commons](../backbone-wordpress/images/spaghetti.png)

jQuery files can get unwieldy



## jQuery does not enforce code
## structure in large applications



### (WordPress is getting pretty large)



## JS Needs within WordPress
## Are Changing



## Eventing: Pub/Sub Pattern

Like WP's actions, but on the front-end



> **Why not use custom jQuery events?**
>
> ...Triggering plain events on the body element (or any other hidden element) is not performant â€” every jQuery event normalizes a DOM Event object, which we then completely ignore.

<small>*~ [@koop](http://twitter.com/koop), discussing [Ticket 21170: JavaScript Actions &amp; Filters](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21170)*</small>


## Where's that ticket at, anyway?

Per [azaozz](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21170#comment:52) in trac, even Backbone doesn't quite let us replicate the way `add_action()`, `add_filter()`, `do_action()` etc, because you can't set priority.

A custom solution will be needed.



## DOM-Vision

jQuery eventing for pub/sub works just fine for many apps, but jQuery is tied to the DOM (and that comes at a cost)



## "Make a jQuery Plugin"
#### is not the solution to everything



## New tools are needed



# Beyond jQuery



![Underscore.js logo](../backbone-wordpress/images/underscore.png)

## Evolution, Not Revolution:

![The relationship between Backbone (for structure), Underscore (for utilities such as templating and functional programming constructs), and jQuery (for DOM manipulation and AJAX)](../backbone-wordpress/images/bb-underscore-jquery-trifecta.png)



## Where does WordPress come in?



## WordPress 3.5's Media Re-Write

> ...Backbone's models, collections, and views are pretty much exactly what we need to be able to make media work as awesome as we're aiming for
>
> <small>~ nacin, [WordPress dev chat, 8/22/12](https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&day=2012-08-22&sort=asc#m442360), relating to [Ticket 21390: Upload/Insert media revamp](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21390)</small>



Thanks to 3.5, Backbone and Underscore<br />are now **shipped in Core** along with WordPress' other JavaScript dependencies



## What is in core, may be enqueue'd



## So let's put these new libraries through their paces



![Underscore.js logo](../backbone-wordpress/images/underscore.png)



## What Is Underscore?

> Underscore is a **utility-belt library** for JavaScript that provides functional programming support without extending any of the built-in JavaScript objects.
>
> <small>*~ Adapted from [underscorejs.org](http://underscorejs.org)*</small>



> ... It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux, and Backbone.js's suspenders.



## Collection Methods

You've got an array or an object of objects, and want to transform it, investigate it or do something to each item?

<br />`_.each`, `_.map`, `_.reduce`, `_.some`,

`_.filter`, `_.every`, `_.min`, `_.max` ...

<br/>*No problem!*



## Functional programming style

Transform objects and collections to make new ones,

rather than altering existing values



## Function Functions

Function binding (forcing `this` to do what you want), throttling or debouncing functions, partial application and currying, making a function that can only fire once...

<br />More at [Underscorejs.org](http://underscorejs.org/#functions)



## Object Utilities

Check to see if an object `_.isNumber`, `_.isArray`, `_.isUndefined`, or `_.isFinite`;

Determine if an object `_.has` a given key...

<br />More at [Underscorejs.org](http://underscorejs.org/#objects)



## Other Utilities

Escaping/Unescaping strings, generating Unique IDs or random numbers, chaining `_.` methods &ldquo;jQuery-style&rdquo;:

Underscore [does all this, too](http://underscorejs.org/#utility)



## And then there's _.template



We'll revisit this in a moment, but JavaScript templating is the best way to build HTML within your scripts



## Markup, the JavaScript Way

Write the template's markup in an easy-to-use, PHP-tag-like syntax, then compile it with `_.template` into something JavaScript interpreters can understand and optimize



```html
<div><%= mainContent %></div>
<a href="<%= link.url %>" title="<%- link.title %>">
  <%= link.text %>
</a>
```
*this* &uparrow; becomes *that* &downarrow;
```javascript
function(obj) {obj || (obj = {}); var __t, __p = '', __e = _.escape;
with (obj) { __p += '<div>' +((__t = ( mainContent )) == null ?
'' : __t) + '</div>\n<a href="' +((__t = ( link.url )) == null ?
'' : __t) + '" title="' +__e( link.title ) +'">\n  ' +
((__t = ( link.text )) == null ? '' : __t) +'\n</a>\n'; }
return __p};
```



**MUCH** faster than building DOM nodes with jQuery

*(And easier to read, too!)*



![Underscore.js logo](../backbone-wordpress/images/underscore.png)

## That's one fine utility belt



## (Underscore is the
## backbone of Backbone.js)



# SO



![Backbone.js logo](../backbone-wordpress/images/backbone.png)



## What is Backbone?

> Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing **models** with key-value binding and custom events, **collections** [to group and manipulate those models], **views** with declarative event handling...
>
> <small>*~ Adapted from [backbonejs.org](http://backbonejs.org); emphasis added*</small>



## Separate Rendering from Logic

**Models** hold your data

**Views** render it on the page & handle user input



## Models

```javascript
var MyModelConstructor = Backbone.Model.extend({});

var modelInstance = new MyModelConstructor({
  prop1: 'some data',
  prop2: 'you want to store in a structured way'
});

console.log( modelInstance.get('prop1') ); // 'some data'
```



## That's a lot of boilerplate...

If you're used to "plain ol' JavaScript",
```javascript
var myData = {
  prop1: 'some data',
  prop2: 'you want to store in a *less* structured way'
};

console.log( myData.prop1 ); // 'some data'
```
Backbone's definitely "more code"



# But It's Worth It
### (trust me)



## For Example:

By using Backbone's Model constructors, your data is augmented with some really useful stuff.
```javascript
model.set({
  prop1: 'new value'
}); // Any `set` triggers a change event on the model
```
The corresponding View can listen for the model's change event, and re-render automatically



## Your Data,

![Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger](../backbone-wordpress/images/harder-better-faster-stronger.png)

<small>*Image by [JopaoxD](http://jopaoxd.deviantart.com/art/Harder-Better-Faster-Stronger-304045878)*</small>



## Views

```javascript
var MyViewConstructor = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: '.my-view-container',
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html([
      this.model.get('prop1'), this.model.get('prop2')
    ].join(''));
    return this;
  },
  initialize: function() {
    this.listenTo( this.model, 'change', this.render );
  }
});
var viewInstance = new MyViewConstructor({ model: modelInstance });
viewInstance.render();
// .my-view-container displays "some data that you want to
//                              store in a structured way"
```
Take that data, give it form



*Definitely* more code than "the jQuery way":
```javascript
$('.my-view-container').html( myData.prop1 + ' ' + myData.prop2 );
```



## But jQuery can't (as easily) do this:
```javascript
modelInstance.set({
  'prop1': 'some NEW data'
});

// view automatically re-renders: .my-view-container now reads
// "some NEW data that you want to store in a structured way"
```



## A little More Work Up Front
## ===
## Less Work Down the Road

The more structured your code is,

the easier it is to fix or modify

## Add Backbone to taste

Backbone is a useful way to structure JS code&mdash;

and you can use as little as you want



Or, you can go a bit crazy :)



## What Is Backbone?, Continued

> Backbone.js gives structure to web applications... and connects it all to your existing API over a **RESTful JSON interface**.



## Who saw Ben's talk on External APIs?

(If you missed it, [check out his slides here](http://ben.lobaugh.net/blog/49651/i-am-speaking-at-wordcamp-chicago-2013-on-interacting-with-external-apis))



## This is that, just in reverse



# Get Your Data
# from WP to JS



## WordPress as an API

WordPress serves your data

Backbone fetches that data, does stuff with it



## .fetch()

```javascript
var Posts = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Post, // constructor to use for items in this collection
  parse: function( response ) {
    return response.posts;
  }
});

var blogPosts = new Posts([], {
  url: '/api/get_recent_posts/'
});
```
Fetch posts from your blog (using the [JSON API](http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/) plugin)



## JSON API plugin

[wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/](http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/)
```javascript
{
  "status": "ok",
  "count": 1,
  "count_total": 1,
  "pages": 1,
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "post",
      "slug": "hello-world",
