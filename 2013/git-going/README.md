## Talk Overview

Version control. Losing your work stinks, so if you don't use a version control system, you should! Git is a distributed system developed by the creator of the Linux operating system to help manage code contributions from a world-wide team of contributors. Github, a code hosting site built on top of Git, launched five years ago this month and has since become the largest code hosting service in the world. Knowing how to use Git isn't just a powerful tool to help your team collaborateâ€”it's become an essential skill required for contributing to many open source projects.

We'll go over the basics of managing your code with Git, both from the command-line and using a graphical interface, then we'll talk about how to get the most out of using Github's powerful toolset to organize your team's WordPress projects.
