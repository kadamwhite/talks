# Talks by [K.Adam White](http://www.kadamwhite.com)

## Introduction

I am a JavaScript developer at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/), and a co-organizer of the [Boston WordPress Meetup Group](http://meetup.bostonwp.org/)&mdash;you can find me on twitter [@kadamwhite](http://twitter.com/kadamwhite). This is a repository of slides from talks and presentations I have given at conferences and meetups over the past several years.

**Technical Disclaimer**

Each slide deck should be taken as representative of what I knew when I wrote the presentation&mdash;older content may consequentially be out-of-date. If you see any technical errors or inaccuracies *vs* current libraries or evolving standards, please [file an issue](https://github.com/kadamwhite/talks/issues) against this repository and I will update the content.

## Technology

These presentations, with limited exceptions, all use in-browser HTML5 slide deck libraries. I am particularly indebted to the authors of the tools listed below, without whom my presentations would have looked considerably less awesome:

* [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), by Hakim El Hattab
* [Slide](https://github.com/incompl/slide), by Greg Smith
